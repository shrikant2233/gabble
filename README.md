# gabble
## Library crate for generating pseudo-word.
### Example
``` rust
use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
let mut rng = thread_rng();

// `Gab` gives gibberish of some moderate length
use gabble::Gab;
let word: Gab = rng.gen();
println!("{} might be answer to life", word);

// `GabLength` gives gibberish of minimum N length
use gabble::GabLength;
let word: GabLength<14> = rng.gen();
println!("{} is a long word", word);
```


Top words
* ilaincy
* gruimsab
* graoness
* duieyaior

Words are generated by combining vowel-consonant syllables. If you want words that closely resembles regular english then look for some library that uses markov chain.
